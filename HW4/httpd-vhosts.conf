# Virtual Hosts
#
# Required modules: mod_log_config

# If you want to maintain multiple domains/hostnames on your
# machine you can setup VirtualHost containers for them. Most configurations
# use only name-based virtual hosts so the server doesn't need to worry about
# IP addresses. This is indicated by the asterisks in the directives below.
#
# Please see the documentation at 
# <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/vhosts/>
# for further details before you try to setup virtual hosts.
#
# You may use the command line option '-S' to verify your virtual host
# configuration.

#
# VirtualHost example:
# Almost any Apache directive may go into a VirtualHost container.
# The first VirtualHost section is used for all requests that do not
# match a ServerName or ServerAlias in any <VirtualHost> block.
#

# This is for domain name to get in
<VirtualHost *:80>
   	#ServerAdmin webmaster@dummy-host.example.com
    DocumentRoot "/usr/local/www/apache24/data"
    ServerName alfons.nctucs.net
    ServerAlias http://alfons.nctucs.net
    ErrorLog "/var/log/dummy-host.example.com-error_log"
    CustomLog "/var/log/dummy-host.example.com-access_log" common
	Redirect / https://alfons.nctucs.net
</VirtualHost>

# This is for IP to get in
<VirtualHost *:80>
    #ServerAdmin webmaster@dummy-host2.example.com
    DocumentRoot "/usr/local/www2/apache24/data"
    ServerName 192.168.56.101
    ErrorLog "/var/log/dummy-host2.example.com-error_log"
    CustomLog "/var/log/dummy-host2.example.com-access_log" common
</VirtualHost>
